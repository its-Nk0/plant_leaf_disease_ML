#  Plant Disease Detection

A beginner-friendly web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using Flask.

## Features

- Easy image upload (drag & drop)
-  AI-powered disease detection
- Visual confidence scores
- Beautiful, modern UI

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If TensorFlow installation fails (Python 3.14), that's OK! The app works without it using mock predictions.

### 2. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Open Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:5000**

That's it! 

**Note:** The app uses mock predictions for demonstration. To use a real model, train one and save it as `models/plant_disease_model.h5`

## Running the Application

### Start the Flask Server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### Open in Browser

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

```

## How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**
   - Click the upload box or drag & drop an image
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP
   - Max file size: 16MB

2. **Get Prediction**
   - Click " Detect Disease" button
   - Wait for the AI to analyze the image
   - View the results with confidence score

3. **Try Another**
   - Click "🔄 Analyze Another Image" to reset

## Configuration

**Change Port:**
```bash
# Set environment variable
$env:PORT=8080  # Windows PowerShell
python app.py
```

**Production Mode:**
The app uses `gunicorn` for production. See `Procfile` for configuration.

## Troubleshooting

**Port in use?** Use a different port: `$env:PORT=8080`

**TensorFlow error?** That's OK! The app works without TensorFlow.

**Import errors?** Make sure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

##  Deployment

Ready to deploy! The project includes:
- `Procfile` for Heroku
- `wsgi.py` for production servers
- `runtime.txt` for Python version

Deploy to Heroku, Railway, Render, or any WSGI-compatible platform.
